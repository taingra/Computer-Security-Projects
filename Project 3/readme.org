#+TITLE: CS4471 Project 3

* Build Instructions
In order to built the host, virus, and seed run `make` or `make all`. To delete
these files run `make clean`.

*

* Mutation Approach
My virus uses encryption to mutate. With each propagation a new key is
generated and stored in the binary. The encryption and decryption is handled
by the decrypt.c program which is appended to the start of each file the
virus has infected. This has the benefit of hiding our virus without
modifying it's source code but has the downside of creating a new piece of
code that is repeated and could potentially be detected. Also, decrypt.c
requires many similar functions to virus.c, but decrypt.c would lack any
malicious logic in the real world.
